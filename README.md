# Algorithms & Data Structures Study Plan

<blockquote>Consistency is Key.
You are making progress and you are growing. Don't forget that.</blockquote>

### Overall Schedule

* 2 hours each week day
    * 5 days/ week
* 3 hours each Saturday
* 3 hours each Sunday

Approximately 16 hours per week.

### Data Structures and Algorithms to Review

One data structure a week. Implement from scratch and make sure you understand them 100%.

1. Arrays/String and multi-demensional arrays
2. Linked Lists
    - Singly LL and Doubly LL
3. Iteration + Recursion
4. Queues + Stacks + Heaps
5. Sets + Hashmaps
6. Tree + Binary Search
7. Graphs + DFS + BFS
8. Tries
9. Sorting
    - Mergesort
    - Quicksort
10. DP
    - Memoization + bottom-up approach
    - Divide and conquer

Plus:

+ Object-oriented Programming
